# How to Contribute

We're really glad you're reading this, because community contributions help all of us in creative computing.

# Submitting a new example

New examples should demonstrate as succinctly as possible a single concept at a time, and given a short, descriptive name.

Each example should come with a `README.md`, which includes an image of the example and a short description of what the example shows and how. You can start with an existing `README.md` and modify the included download link to point to your example.

Once you've got your example ready, you can [send a new pull request](https://github.com/XRRCA/CreativeCoding/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). Always write a clear log message for your commits.
