# Collision Detection with blobs

Detects when the mouse clicks on a set of blobs created using image editing software that are invisible to the user. Similar to how hitboxes work, we can use a mask image to hide "trigger" areas.

This example uses a fill algorithm similar to how the paintbucket works in photoshop to identify which blob has been clicked on and associate it with a user-defined marker.
