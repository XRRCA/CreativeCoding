# Kinect Bodytracking OSC Example

![Screen recording of a camera showing someone walking around a room, with audio data reacting to their position in the room](kinect-bodytracking-osc.gif)

Uses the Kinect Azure Depth camera's bodytracking functionality to track positions on the body and send out their cartisian coordinates (X, Y, Z) over Open Sound Control (OSC).

Can also use the Kinect 1/2 using the _Kinect CHOP_.

The example uses ambisonics to position a sound within a 360 soundfield, [click here for more info on _Spatial Audio_](https://github.com/XRRCA/SpatLab/wiki).

It also makes use of the Spatial Audio Lab in RCA White City, but you can use any Speaker Decoder and the Binaural Decoder to monitor the audio.
